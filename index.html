        <p class="details__desc">Inspired by the free and passionate woman who became Coco Chanel, GABRIELLE CHANEL
          ESSENCE is a more voluptuous, intensely feminine interpretation of the original GABRIELLE CHANEL luminous
          floral
          fragrance. The striking square glass bottle is reimagined with bolder golden accents on the stopper and label.
        </p>
        <h3 class="details__subtitle">Composition</h3>
        <p class="details__desc">Composed by In-House Perfumer Creator Olivier Polge, this deep and enveloping scent
          evokes the true essence of Gabrielle Chanel. The fragrance is an imaginary bloom, faceted with jasmine,
          ylang-ylang, orange blossom and the most captivating flower of all: Grasse tuberose. Solar and radiant with a
          warm trail, it is the scent of a woman who follows her own path.</p>
